# Language Flashcards Web App

A dynamic, language-learning web app that helps users learn languages through flashcards and lessons. The app currently supports Polish and Bengali, offering both lessons and test modes with smooth navigation and interactive features.

## Features

### 1. **Language Selection**
- Users can choose between **Polish** and **Bengali**.
- On selecting a language, the app automatically loads the **Lessons** mode by default.

### 2. **Lessons Mode**
- Displays vocabulary in organized tables based on categories (e.g., Greetings, Numbers, etc.).
- **Navigation buttons**: Dynamic buttons are generated at the top of the lessons screen. Each button corresponds to a specific table (category) and allows the user to smoothly scroll to the respective section.
- **"Go to top" link**: A floating link at the bottom-right of the screen that allows users to scroll to the top of the page with a smooth scrolling effect.
- Each table contains the following columns:
  - **Phrase**: The phrase in the target language.
  - **Pronunciation**: How to pronounce the phrase.
  - **English Translation**: The English translation of the phrase.

### 3. **Test Mode**
- The test mode displays interactive flashcards for practicing vocabulary.
- Users can flip the flashcards to see the pronunciation and translation of the phrase.
- Each flashcard contains:
  - **Front**: The phrase in the target language.
  - **Back**: The pronunciation and English translation.
- Buttons are dynamically generated for each category, allowing users to test themselves on different sets of vocabulary.
